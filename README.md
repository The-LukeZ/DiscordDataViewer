## Privacy & Security

This application prioritizes your data privacy:

- **End-to-end encryption**: All Discord data is encrypted client-side before being stored
- **Zero-knowledge storage**: Data is stored encrypted in KV workers - even the developer cannot read your stored data (well, I could manually decrypt it, but I won't)
- **Temporary credentials**: Credentials are stored for only one day, after which they are automatically deleted, and the cookie expires
- **Secure authentication**: Uses Discord's OAuth2 for secure login
- **No data retention**: You control your data and can delete it at any time
